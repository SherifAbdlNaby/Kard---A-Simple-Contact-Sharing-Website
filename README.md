# Description

-Kard is a simple website were you register and fill your contact information, basic information, and social networks profiles so that you'd be able to share all your contact information by a single link.

-Have you ever been in the situation when you've just met someone and he asks for your mobile number, Facebook, LinkedIn, and your Twitter ? Usually you will cycle along your profiles, copy and send each profile's link separately. This where Kard comes in handy, you will only fill your information once and use a single link to share, also if you changed one of your contact infos.  (ex. Phone No. or Email ) It will be updated for every one who has the link and you won't have to share your updated phone number to everyone again.

-Kard comes in handy also if you're trying to put your contact infos in a printed materials like a 'C'ard or a Brochure and you're struggling with space, you can put Kard's link as a substitution or generate a QR code for Kard's link to be scanned.

-Kard also has a search feature that allows you to search for people by name, username, phone, or email.

-You can choose to hide you Kard from search results by 'unlisting' your profile which can be found in the 'My Account' section.
